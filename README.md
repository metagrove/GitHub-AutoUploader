🚀 GitHub Auto Uploader 🤖✨
A lazy-friendly, Git-free upload machine

Tired of typing git push like it's your job?
GitHub Auto Uploader is here to save your precious keystrokes.
It’s a terminal-based tool that uploads your files and directories straight to GitHub using the GitHub API  no git install required.
Seriously. Zero git. It’s like teleportation, but for your code.

💼 What It Does
📦 Creates GitHub repositories for you (like a digital intern)

📤 Uploads files and folders directly (even entire directories!)

⏰ Lets you schedule uploads at specific times (hello, 3AM deployments)

🔁 Repeat uploads as often as you want — automation nation

⚙️ Works via the GitHub API, no git init, no git commit, no problem

⚗️ What's Cooking
This is the first test version, made to check the flow and API integration.
🚧 Coming soon:

Run this tool as a server with a cron job (automate like a boss)

Upload logs, web dashboard, Slack notifications — we dream big

Maybe it'll even make coffee someday ☕️ (we're working on it… maybe)

🛠 Requirements
Python 3

A GitHub personal access token (with repo permissions)

Basic human curiosity

Internet access (surprise!)

📅 Use Cases
Auto-upload your assignments just before deadlines (😅)

Back up your memes folder daily at midnight

Schedule uploads of secret projects while you sleep

💡 Real Talk
This isn't just a script — it's an anti-git rebellion.
No more merge conflicts. No more detached HEADs.
Just upload your files. Boom. Done.

⭐ Like It? Star It.
🧪 Hate It? Fork It and improve it.
📦 Want to contribute? PRs are welcome but only if you're cool.

Built with Python, a dash of sarcasm, and no regrets.
